# 🧠 Turing Machine Project – Decidability & Undecidability

This project explores key concepts in **Theory of Computation**, focusing on **decidability** and **undecidability** through simulations of Turing Machines using Python.

It includes command-line simulations for classic problems like:
- ✅ Palindrome Checker (Decidable)
- ❌ Halting Problem (Undecidable)

---

## 🚀 Features

- ✅ Python-based CLI Turing Machine simulator
- 🔁 Step-by-step transitions for custom inputs
- 📚 Demonstrates theoretical concepts with real code
- 🧠 Educational use for TOC students & enthusiasts
- 📝 Full project report included (PDF)

---
