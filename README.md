## Introduction

The Turing Machine is a fundamental concept in computer science, introduced by Alan Turing in 1936. It serves as a model for computation, helping us understand what problems can be solved algorithmically. This project provides simulations of Turing Machines to illustrate concepts like decidability and the halting problem.

## Features

- **Turing Machine Simulations**: Visualize how Turing Machines operate.
- **Decidability Exploration**: Investigate problems that can and cannot be solved.
- **Halting Problem Analysis**: Understand the limitations of algorithmic solutions.
- **User-Friendly CLI**: Interact with the project through a simple command-line interface.

## Installation

To get started, clone the repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Ruso37/Turing-Machine-Project.git
```

Navigate into the project directory:

```bash
cd Turing-Machine-Project
```

Install the required packages using pip:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

Run the project by executing the following command in your terminal:

```bash
python main.py
```

Follow the prompts to simulate different Turing Machines and explore various problems.

## Topics Covered

This project addresses several key topics in the field of computation:

- **Automata**: Understand the basic principles of automata theory.
- **Computability**: Explore what can be computed and what cannot.
- **Decidability**: Learn about problems that can be algorithmically solved.
- **Halting Problem**: Investigate the limits of computation with this classic problem.
- **Theory of Computation**: Gain insights into foundational concepts in computer science.
